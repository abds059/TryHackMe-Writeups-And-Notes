# Bash Scripting

## Task 1 - Introduction

### What is BASH ?

Bash is a scripting language that runs on most linux distros as well as MACOS. Shell scripts are a sequence of bash commands within a file which are useful in achieving sysadmin tasks such as backups.

These are a few topics that are included here:

- Bash syntax
- Variables
- Using parameters
- Arrays
- Conditionals

A useful resource for learning bash is listed here [https://devhints.io/bash](https://devhints.io/bash)

## Task 2 - Our Simple Bash Script

A bash script always starts with the following line at the top of the script:

`#!/bin/bash`

The command “echo” is used to output text to the screen, the same way as “print” in python. We can also run linux commands inside the script. 

### Running The Script

In order to run our bash script we must first give it executable permissions

`Chmod +x yourfile.sh`

And then we run it using `./`

### Answer the questions below

What piece of code can we insert at the start of a line to comment out our code?

`#`

What will the following script output to the screen, echo “BishBashBosh”

`BishBashBosh`

## Task 9 - The view from my hotel room

Here we were given a video file which we had to search through.

A tool called **ffmpeg** was also mentioned as a resource which I downloaded through the [github repo](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases). After installation I referenced this [video](https://youtu.be/qjtmgCb8NcE?si=8s9lD1g2oKNrAeLa) for the setup.

After setup go to the folder where your video file is and type this command in cmd: `ffmpeg -i myvideo.mp4 -r 1 img%06d.png -hide_banner`. The video will break down into frames making it easy to recognize any fruitful information.

However we can also do the recon without this tool easily by playing the video.

From the obtained frames I got a place called **Riverside Point** which I searched through google maps and found out there is place called **CLark Quay** in front of it but no visible hotels. Upon opening Clark Quay (I searched through writeups and got the hint that the hotel used to be here) in google street view I found an image of **novotel singapore clarke quay hotel** which was the answer to the question.
